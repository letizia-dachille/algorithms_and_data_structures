# Algorithms and Data Structures
<p> Rewriting of end-of-course projects in Algorithms and Data Structures by Francesco Caporali and Letizia D'Achille. The work consists of merging and improving two separate projects presented individually. We tried to maximize efficiency in time and memory. The work is written completely in Italian. <p>

Title of the project: <em>City route planner</em> 
  
# Description
The source code in C++ can be found in [code/c++](https://github.com/letizia-dachille/algorithms_and_data_structures/blob/main/code/c++). The data is located in the [paris](https://github.com/letizia-dachille/algorithms_and_data_structures/blob/main/paris) folder, it has been manipulated through some scripts in bash to result in a partial sorting.
The main code to be executed is [main.cpp](https://github.com/letizia-dachille/algorithms_and_data_structures/blob/main/code/c++/main.cpp).

All files are accompanied by brief comments (written in italian). <br>
